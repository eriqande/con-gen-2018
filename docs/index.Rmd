## Notes and things from Eric's First Presentation

- [bayes-mcmc-gtyp-narrative.nb.html](bayes-mcmc-gtyp-narrative.nb.html). An R-notebook (in its
HTML incarnation) of Eric's narrative notes for his first presentation.
- [con-gen-2017 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/eriqande/con-gen-2017).  This would be the
thing to clone if you wanted to reproduce
`bayes-mcmc-gtyp-narrative.nb.html`. Do so by running the notebook at
`./lectures/bayes-mcmc-gtyp-narrative.Rmd` in the repository
- [gbs-miscall-rates repo](https://github.com/eriqande/gbs-miscall-rates). This is the GitHub 
repository that holds all the code and the data sets used to estimate genotyping error rates in
RAD data sets.
